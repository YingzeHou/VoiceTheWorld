App that help visually impaired group of people learn about their surrounding world

## Page Instruction
Camera Page: 
- **Single Image Mode**: User can take a photo and the AI facilitated app will describe the surrounding that this photo shows.
- **Panoramic Mode**: User is prompted to take one photo in each direction (front, right, back, left), so that the app can combine these four images together to generate an overall sense of the 360 degree of surrounding environment from the user's perspective.

Video Page:
This page is intended to function as a live mode: The user simply hold up the phone and the phone camera will be continuously streaming. The app will analyze and generate surrounding environment description based on the real-time streaming video. The ideal state of this function is to be a real-time "eye" for visually-impaired users.
